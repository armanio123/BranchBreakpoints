# Branch Breakpoints

Branch Breakpoints will keep track of your breakpoints using git branches.

Everytime a new breakpoint is set, Branch Breakpoints will save it on the current existing branch. When you load a new branch it will clear all breakpoints for starting a clean slate. After returning to the previous branch it will load that branch saved breakpoints so that you can continue your work seamlessly.

## Getting started
1. Install the extension.
1. Use git as your source version control system.
